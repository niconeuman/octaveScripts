The files in this folder have a minimal functionality.
They rely on parameters that were figured out for specific files.

analyzeNEB.m:
The number of images (nIm and nImZOOM), lastNEB and possibly other variables are tailored for a specific file, and have to be changed based on the specific trajectory file
that is opened.
There are other things that will probably not work first hand and need to be optimized for a particular file.
Only open trajectory files from Orca, or xyz files that contain the following structure:

"Number of atoms"
"some text with five separate words and an energy value"
"AtomType x y z"
